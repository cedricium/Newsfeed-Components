        <h2>I Have Moved</h2>
        <p class="date">Dec 12th, 2018</p>
        <p>No, I haven’t moved physically. Rather, I’ve moved my blog. My first blog,
          <em>coffee. code. cedric</em>, was hosted on Medium when that was the cool thing to do.
          I even had a custom domain for my publication before that
          <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487%0A-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation">feature was
            steamrolled</a>.
        </p>
        <p>To be honest, I struggled with keeping the blog up-to-date. In many of my posts,
          I would make commitments to write more often which turned out to never come true.
          Not only that, I felt as though I had limited myself in the number of topics I
          could write about since the original blog was geared towards programming and
          Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, when my old domain expired and the link to my Medium publication broke, I
          decided to not fix it and instead told myself that I will host my own blog. Along
          with that, I also made the decision to not limit myself in the type of content I
          write about. What does that mean for this blog then? Well, anything goes. Be it
          related to programming, philosophy, design, or my day, I won’t think twice and
          worry about whether or not a post should belong on this blog.
        </p>
        <p>Although I pretty much failed at having a blog before, I do enjoy writing (even
          if I’m bad at it) and hope this blog will allow me to pursue this passion further.
          So for now, I bid you adieu and I look forward to see where things go from here.

        <h2>Advice for Beginners</h2>
        <p class="date">Dec 15th, 2018</p>
        <p><em>Originally published on the r/learnprogrammig subreddit.</em></p>
        <h4>For those struggling and comparing themselves to others…</h4>
        <p>
          I’m right there with you. I’ve been programming for about three years now and
          although I wouldn’t consider myself a beginner, I’m by no means an expert and
          still feel like programming can be hard or that the code I write is shit. I
          can’t help but see all of the other developers I follow on social media and
          the projects they’re making and feel like I’ll never get there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best advice I’ve heard until recently to dealing with this are sayings like
          “don’t compare your beginning to someone else’s middle”. That makes sense and I
          understood what it meant, but I was never really satisfied with when my “middle”
          would manifest - I felt like no matter how many projects I made, I was not
          progressing.
        </p>
        <p>That is until I heard Ira Glass’ advice for beginners.</p>
        <p>
          Simply put, Glass describes the idea that there is a gap between our good taste
          (the cool projects we aspire to one day write) and the stuff we actually make
          (the code we write/the projects we’re actually making). The gap represents our
          dissatisfaction with our work compared to the work that we aspire to someday
          create.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can’t summarize Glass’ words in their full glory but luckily the transcript
          isn’t too long, so I’ll paste it below:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had</em>
            <em>told this to me.</em></p>
          <p><em>All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But</em>
            <em>it’s like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you’re making</em>
            <em>stuff, what you’re making isn’t so good. It’s not that great. It’s trying to</em>
            <em>be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not that good.</em></p>
          <p><em>But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And</em>
            <em>your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you’re making is kind</em>
            <em>of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They</em>
            <em>quit.</em></p>
          <p><em>Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years</em>
            <em>where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were</em>
            <em>making wasn’t as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short.</em>
            <em>Everybody goes through that.</em></p>
          <p><em>And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta</em>
            <em>know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.</em>
            <em>Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or</em>
            <em>every month you know you’re going to finish one story. It is only by going</em>
            <em>through a volume of work that you’re going to catch up and close that gap.</em>
            <em>And the work you’re making will be as good as your ambitions.</em></p>
          <p><em>I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It</em>
            <em>takes awhile. It’s gonna take you a while. It’s normal to take a while.</em>
            <em>You just have to fight your way through that.</em></p>
          <p>—Ira Glass</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I’m not sure about you, but this explanation about the pursuit of evolving our
          creativity made me have a light bulb moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think Glass perfectly describes why we shouldn’t “compare our beginning to
          someone else’s middle” while at the same time sheds light on the true struggle
          we as beginners go through while honing our creative skills (such as programming).
          I also felt like the idea to create a volume of work in order to close the gap
          really goes in hand with Malcolm Gladwell’s “10,000-Hour Rule”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apologies for the wall of text, I’ll stop here. If you’re more of a visual
          learner, the comic Zen Pencils has an excellent interpretation of Ira Glass’
          words.<sup>1</sup> Happy coding and hopefully some of you will
          have found this as insightful as I did!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>EDIT</strong>: I’m ecstatic that so many of you have found this advice helpful. I
          made Glass’ advice into a nice little r/GetMotivated-esque poster.<sup>2</sup>
